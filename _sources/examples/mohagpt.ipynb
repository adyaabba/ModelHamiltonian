    "# Tutorial: Easy Quantum System Setup with ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our ChatGPT-powered tutorial on setting up Hamiltonians for quantum systems! Get ready to dive into the quantum world effortlessly. Let's spice things up with some visual flair!\n",

    "## What You Can Do with ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "With ChatGPT, you're in control! Here's what you can tweak:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customize Your System\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Electrons**: Adjust the number of electrons buzzing around.\n",
    "- **Orbitals**: Play with the spatial arrangement by setting the orbital count.\n",
    "- **Symmetry**: Fine-tune the electron integrals' symmetry.\n",
    "- **Connectivity**: Choose between periodic or open boundaries, and explore 1D chains or 2D lattices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tailor Your Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Occupation-based**: Set energies for each orbital, tweak interactions between neighboring orbitals, and manage Coulomb repulsion between electrons.\n",
    "- **Spin-based**: Adjust couplings between electrons on the same or adjacent orbitals, and control the strength of the magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Giving full control to ChatGPT can lead to some unexpected results. But don't worry, we've got you covered with a few presets to get you started. Let's dive in!"
